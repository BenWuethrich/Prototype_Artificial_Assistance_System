"""This was originally a sample for a translation fulfillment webhook for an Dialogflow agent. 
The original project by Google Inc. is available under https://github.com/dialogflow/fulfillment-translate-python

Benjamin WÃ¼thrich (wuethrich.benjamin@gmail.com) amended the code and converted it into a 
prototype for an artificial assistance system (AAS) as part of his Master Thesis for the program 
MSc in Business Information Systems at University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland

Following Use Cases of the Master Thesis are part of the Prototye of the AAS: 
- Use Case 2: Propose planning
- Use Case 3: Manage list of pending items
